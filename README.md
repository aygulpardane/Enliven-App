## Enliven - Plant care tracking app

Do you love collecting plants and decorating your living and working spaces with them? Nothing is better than coming home to see your plants thriving, knowing they’re purifying your air. But do you struggle to keep track of when to water, re-pot, and mist them? That’s a common struggle among plant lovers and you’re not alone. Enliven is here to lend a node, sorry, a hand!
Use Enliven to keep track of your indoor plants - their water, light, and soil needs. Add your plants to your portfolio, answer some questions about your plants and Enliven will provide the rest. Enliven will even make plant recommendations based on your personality; are you an under-waterer, over-waterer, or are you a normal person?
